GeoPDEs has been released along with a [**technical report**]() explaining its design and its main features, to be used as a brief user's guide. The technical report is included among the files to [**download**](../download).



# Function help

Each function in GeoPDEs comes with a detailed help, explaining its functionality and its input and output arguments. The documentation for each function can be accessed with the _help_ command, as for any other Octave/Matlab function. 

The list of available functions in GeoPDEs is available in the INDEX file, inside the package. It can also be accessed with the command (Matlab users only) _help geopdes_.

# Getting support

If you require further help, please subscribe to the GeoPDEs-users [**mailing list**](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geopdes-users), and send your questions to the list.
