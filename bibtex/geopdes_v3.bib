  abstract = {GeoPDEs (http://rafavzqz.github.io/geopdes) is an Octave/Matlab package for the solution of partial differential equations with isogeometric analysis, first released in 2010. In this work we present in detail the new design of the package, based on the use of Octave and Matlab classes. Compared to previous versions the new design is much clearer, and it is also more efficient in terms of memory consumption and computational time.},
