GeoPDEs has been released along with a [**technical report**](http://bibliograzia.imati.cnr.it/reports/new-design-implementation-isogeometric-analysis) ([article version](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.camwa.2016.05.010)) explaining its design and its main features, to be used as a brief user's guide. The technical report is included among the files to [**download**](../download).

# <a name="examples"></a>Getting started: running the examples

GeoPDEs contains a set of simple examples, that can be run with the commands:

* geopdes_base_examples
* geopdes_elasticity_examples
* geopdes_fluid_examples
* geopdes_maxwell_examples
 
These will guide you through a set of menus to choose some examples for solving different model problems.

# Function help

Each function in GeoPDEs comes with a detailed help, explaining its functionality and its input and output arguments. The documentation for each function can be accessed with the _help_ command, as for any other Octave/Matlab function. 

After the installation, the list of available functions in GeoPDEs can be accessed with the commands  
_pkg describe -verbose geopdes_ (Octave users)  
_help geopdes_ (Matlab users, or Octave users not using the pkg installation).

# Getting support

If you require further help, please subscribe to the GeoPDEs-users [**mailing list**](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/geopdes-users), and send your questions to the list.
